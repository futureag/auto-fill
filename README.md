Code for MVP reservoir filler
A relay is used to control a pond pump that moves nutrient from a 5 gallon bucket to the reservoir.
Activiation of the pump is determined by water level, which is judged via electrical conductivity.

Parts:
5 gallon plastic bucket (used to mix and store nutrients)
1/2 inch black plastic hose (black prevents algae growth)
90 degree 1/2 elbow (used to direct flow into reservoir)
440 gph (gallon per hour) pond pump
moisture probe (https://www.amazon.com/HONG111-Sensitivity-Moisture-Arduino-Watering/dp/B01NCI629O/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1547734531&sr=8-5&keywords=arduino+moisture+probe)
Though I just saw this, and it may be a good alternative (avoids building your own probe)(https://www.amazon.com/Fevas-Moisture-Detection-Corrosion-Resistance/dp/B07MKCX1NZ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1547735325&sr=8-3&keywords=arduino+moisture+probe)

If building your own probe, you will need from the hardware store:
2 1/8 inch stainless steel threaded rods
4 stainless steel nuts (1/8 inch)
